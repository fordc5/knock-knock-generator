Status Report <br />
NLP Final Project <br />
“Jokes on you”

### Members: <br />
Connor Ford and Gabe Magee

### Summary:
- We are currently generating a single class of knock-knock joke: <br />
(a) knock knock <br />
(b) who's there? <br />
(a) _token_ <br />
(b) _token_ who? <br />
(a) Response related to _token_ + 'ew'/'who' sounding word.
- We first iterate over a list of English words searching for those that end in an 'ew'/'who' sound. 
- Then we take the base (token) of the word minus the 'ew'/'who' sound.
- The token 

### Results: 
Joke #1 - 

### Problems: 
- We are currently generating a small sample size of jokes. We have about 15 tokens for our joke format and don't forsee adding many more to this count. We might add an additional class of knock-knock jokes to extend this a bit.
